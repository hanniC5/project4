MY EMOTIONAL SPACE

My(emotional)space is a prototype for an empathy-based user experience, taking the form of a sample social media profile page. Sign in with a URL of a user's photo and see the user interface change based on the user's emotional state! News stories, a song recommendation, plus dynamic background colors change to reflect the user's emotional state.
My(emotional)space is built using the Microsoft Face API(https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/cognitive-services/face/). Photos URLs are sent via AJAX to this API, which returns a JSON object featuring level ratings of eight emotions, plus an age and "smile rating". No data about race or gender is received by my(emotiona)space! 
My(emotional)space was built by Hannah Crump and Laura-Louise Tobin as part of Hacker You's Web Development Bootcamp in 2018.
